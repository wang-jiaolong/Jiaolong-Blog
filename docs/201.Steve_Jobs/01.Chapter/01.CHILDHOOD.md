## The Adoption

When Paul Jobs was mustered out of the Coast Guard after World War II, he made a wager with his crewmates . They had arrived in San Francisco, where their ship was decommissioned, and Paul bet that he would find himself a wife within two weeks. He was a taut, tattooed engine mechanic, six feet tall, with a passing resemblance to James Dean. But it wasn’t his looks that got him a date with Clara Hagopian, a sweet-humored daughter of Armenian immigrants. It was the fact that he and his friends had a car, unlike the group she had originally planned to go out with that evening. Ten days later, in March 1946, Paul got engaged to Clara and won his wager. It would turn out to be a happy marriage, one that lasted until death parted them more than forty years later.

第二次世界大战后，保罗·莱因霍尔德·乔布斯（Paul Reinhold Jobs）从海岸警卫队退役时，与他的队员们打了一个赌。他们已经到达旧金山，在这里，他们的舰船退役了，保罗打赌说他会在两周之内给自己找到一个妻子。他是一个肌肉结实、有着文身的引擎机械师，身高6英尺，长相有几分像詹姆斯·迪恩。他约到了克拉拉·哈戈皮安（Clara Hagopian)，一个来自亚美尼亚移民家庭的甜美风趣的女孩子。女孩看上的并不是他的容貌，而是他和他的朋友们可以使用一辆轿车，这是她当晚原定与之出行的对象们做不到的。10天以后，1946年3月，保罗与克拉拉订婚，同时也赢了那场赌局。事实证明，这是一段幸福的婚姻，两人厮守了40多年，直至死亡将他们分开。

Paul Reinhold Jobs had been raised on a dairy farm in Germantown, Wisconsin. Even though his father was an alcoholic and sometimes abusive, Paul ended up with a gentle and calm disposition under his leathery exterior. After dropping out of high school, he wandered through the Midwest picking up work as a mechanic until, at age nineteen, he joined the Coast Guard, even though he didn’t know how to swim. He was deployed on the USS *General M. C. Meigs* and spent much of the war ferrying troops to Italy for General Patton. His talent as a machinist and fireman earned him commendations, but he occasionally found himself in minor trouble and never rose above the rank of seaman.

保罗·莱因霍尔德·乔布斯在威斯康星州日耳曼敦的一家奶牛场长大。尽管父亲是个酒鬼，有时候还会虐待他，但在保罗粗犷的外表下却有着一颗温柔宁静的心。高中退学后，他穿梭于中西部地区，做机械师的工作，直到19岁那年加入海岸警卫队——虽然他并不会游泳。他被安排在美国海军的梅格斯号运兵船（USS M.C. Meigs）上，“二战”中的大多数时间都在为巴顿将军向意大利运输部队。他作为一名机械师和锅炉工，表现不俗，并为他赢得了不少奖励，但他偶尔也会惹上一点儿小麻烦，所以军衔从来没有高过一等兵。
