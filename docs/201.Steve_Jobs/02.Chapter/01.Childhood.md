## The Adoption

When Paul Jobs was mustered out of the Coast Guard after World War II, he made a wager with his crewmates . They had arrived in San Francisco, where their ship was decommissioned, and Paul bet that he would find himself a wife within two weeks. He was a taut, tattooed engine mechanic, six feet tall, with a passing resemblance to James Dean. But it wasn’t his looks that got him a date with Clara Hagopian, a sweet-humored daughter of Armenian immigrants. It was the fact that he and his friends had a car, unlike the group she had originally planned to go out with that evening. Ten days later, in March 1946, Paul got engaged to Clara and won his wager. It would turn out to be a happy marriage, one that lasted until death parted them more than forty years later.

Paul Reinhold Jobs had been raised on a dairy farm in Germantown, Wisconsin. Even though his father was an alcoholic and sometimes abusive, Paul ended up with a gentle and calm disposition under his leathery exterior. After dropping out of high school, he wandered through the Midwest picking up work as a mechanic until, at age nineteen, he joined the Coast Guard, even though he didn’t know how to swim. He was deployed on the USS *General M. C. Meigs* and spent much of the war ferrying troops to Italy for General Patton. His talent as a machinist and fireman earned him commendations, but he occasionally found himself in minor trouble and never rose above the rank of seaman.

Clara was born in New Jersey, where her parents had landed after fleeing the Turks in Armenia, and they moved to the Mission District of San Francisco when she was a child. She had a secret that she rarely mentioned to anyone: She had been married before, but her husband had been killed in the war. So when she met Paul Jobs on that first date, she was primed to start a new life.

Like many who lived through the war, they had experienced enough excitement that, when it was over, they desired simply to settle down, raise a family, and lead a less eventful life. They had little money, so they moved to Wisconsin and lived with Paul’s parents for a few years, then headed for Indiana, where he got a job as a machinist for International Harvester. His passion was tinkering with old cars, and he made money in his spare time buying, restoring, and selling them. Eventually he quit his day job to become a full-time used car salesman.

Clara, however, loved San Francisco, and in 1952 she convinced her husband to move back there. They got an apartment in the Sunset District facing the Pacific, just south of Golden Gate Park, and he took a job working for a finance company as a “repo man,” picking the locks of cars whose owners hadn’t paid their loans and repossessing them. He also bought, repaired, and sold some of the cars, making a decent enough living in the process.

There was, however, something missing in their lives. They wanted children, but Clara had suffered an ectopic pregnancy, in which the fertilized egg was implanted in a fallopian tube rather than the uterus, and she had been unable to have any. So by 1955, after nine years of marriage, they were looking to adopt a child.

Like Paul Jobs, Joanne Schieble was from a rural Wisconsin family of German heritage. Her father, Arthur Schieble, had immigrated to the outskirts of Green Bay, where he and his wife owned a mink farm and dabbled successfully in various other businesses, including real estate and photoengraving. He was very strict, especially regarding his daughter’s relationships, and he had strongly disapproved of her first love, an artist who was not a Catholic. Thus it was no surprise that he threatened to cut Joanne off completely when, as a graduate student at the University of Wisconsin, she fell in love with Abdulfattah “John” Jandali, a Muslim teaching assistant from Syria.

Jandali was the youngest of nine children in a prominent Syrian family. His father owned oil refineries and multiple other businesses, with large holdings in Damascus and Homs, and at one point pretty much controlled the price of wheat in the region. His mother, he later said, was a “traditional Muslim woman” who was a “conservative, obedient housewife.” Like the Schieble family, the Jandalis put a premium on education. Abdulfattah was sent to a Jesuit boarding school, even though he was Muslim, and he got an undergraduate degree at the American University in Beirut before entering the University of Wisconsin to pursue a doctoral degree in political science.

第二次世界大战后，保罗·莱因霍尔德·乔布斯（Paul Reinhold Jobs）从海岸警卫队退役时，与他的队员们打了一个赌。他们已经到达旧金山，在这里，他们的舰船退役了，保罗打赌说他会在两周之内给自己找到一个妻子。他是一个肌肉结实、有着文身的引擎机械师，身高6英尺，长相有几分像詹姆斯·迪恩。他约到了克拉拉·哈戈皮安（Clara Hagopian)，一个来自亚美尼亚移民家庭的甜美风趣的女孩子。女孩看上的并不是他的容貌，而是他和他的朋友们可以使用一辆轿车，这是她当晚原定与之出行的对象们做不到的。10天以后，1946年3月，保罗与克拉拉订婚，同时也赢了那场赌局。事实证明，这是一段幸福的婚姻，两人厮守了40多年，直至死亡将他们分开。

保罗·莱因霍尔德·乔布斯在威斯康星州日耳曼敦的一家奶牛场长大。尽管父亲是个酒鬼，有时候还会虐待他，但在保罗粗犷的外表下却有着一颗温柔宁静的心。高中退学后，他穿梭于中西部地区，做机械师的工作，直到19岁那年加入海岸警卫队——虽然他并不会游泳。他被安排在美国海军的梅格斯号运兵船（USS M.C. Meigs）上，“二战”中的大多数时间都在为巴顿将军向意大利运输部队。他作为一名机械师和锅炉工，表现不俗，并为他赢得了不少奖励，但他偶尔也会惹上一点儿小麻烦，所以军衔从来没有高过一等兵。

克拉拉出生在新泽西州，她的父母逃离土耳其控制下的亚美尼亚之后，落脚在这里。在她童年时，全家搬到了旧金山的米申区。她有一个很少对外提及的秘密：她曾经结过婚，但她的丈夫在战争中身亡了。所以当她第一次和保罗约会时，心中已经准备好迎接崭新的生活了。

和许多从战争中走过的人一样，他们已经经历了太多的刺激，所以当战争结束之后，他们渴望安定下来，生儿育女，过平静的生活。他们没有多少钱，所以搬到威斯康星州与保罗的父母一起居住了几年，然后又去了印第安纳州，在那里，保罗找到了一份工作——在国际收割机公司（International Harvester）做机械师。他喜欢修理汽车，业余时间靠买下旧车修好后再卖出去赚钱。最后，他辞去了工作，成了一名全职的二手车商人。

然而，克拉拉深爱着旧金山。1952年，她终于说服丈夫，全家搬回了旧金山。他们在日落区买下了一套公寓，地处金门公园南端，面朝太平洋。保罗在一家信贷公司找到了一份“回收人”的工作——撬开不能偿还贷款的车主的车锁，将车拖回并重新处置。有时候他也会买下这样的车，修好后出售，就这样靠赚到的钱过着小康生活。

但他们的生活中却始终缺少一样东西。他们想要一个孩子，但克拉拉经历过一次宫外孕而丧失了生育能力。1955年，也就是结婚9年后，他们开始寻求领养一个孩子。

与保罗·乔布斯一样，乔安妮·席贝尔（Joanne Schieble）也来自威斯康星乡村的一个德裔家庭。她的父亲名叫亚瑟·席贝尔（Arthur Schieble），他移民美国后辗转来到了格林贝（Green Bay）的郊区。他和妻子在这里拥有一家水貂饲养场，还成功涉足了其他一些生意，其中包括房地产和照相凸版印刷。他很严厉，尤其是在对待女儿的恋爱问题上，他坚决反对女儿和初恋对象的交往，因为此人不是天主教徒。所以，当在威斯康星大学读研究生的乔安妮爱上了一个来自叙利亚的穆斯林助教“约翰”阿卜杜勒法塔赫·钱德里（Abdulfattah“John”Jandali）时，他威胁要与之断绝父女关系，就一点儿也不让人惊讶了。

钱德里来自一个显赫的叙利亚家庭，是家里9个孩子中年纪最小的一个。他的父亲拥有多家炼油厂和其他多种产业，在大马士革和霍姆斯也有大量财产，还一度控制了那一地区的小麦价格。钱德里后来提到，他的母亲是一位“传统的穆斯林女性”，她就是“保守、顺从的家庭主妇”。和席贝尔家一样，钱德里家族也十分重视教育，好几代以来，家庭成员都被送到伊斯坦布尔或者巴黎索邦大学就读。阿卜杜勒法塔赫·钱德里就曾被送到一所耶稣会寄宿学校，尽管他是个穆斯林。他在贝鲁特美国大学（American University in Beirut）拿到了学士学位，然后来到了威斯康星大学，在政治学系攻读博士学位。
